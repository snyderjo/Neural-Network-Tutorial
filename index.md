## Neural Network Tutorial

Back in 2017, I took Andrew Ng's Coursera class in machine learning.  I was inspired to firm up the knowledge contained within.

The [code](https://github.com/snyderjo/Neural-Network-Tutorial) contained represents my successful attempt at creating and estimating fully-connected neural network models.  This firmed up my knowledge of:
1. Python
2. numpy
3. Neural networks
4. backpropigation

This was among my initial projects in python and git.

Several years later, I added the code necessary to make it a module and provided a virtual envitonment (along with a handful of necessary updates).
