# Neural-Network-Tutorial  

The purpose of this repositpory is two-fold:  
-[x] Demonstrate/develop knowledge of how fully-connected neural networks function, and   
-[x] Develop functional knowledge of python.  

## Questions  
__1. Why on earth would you write this from scratch, when you could accomplish this using 4 lines of Keras?__  
_I am creating this from the ground up for the sake of my own erudition.  I have no expectation that this code is either efficient or aesthetically pleasing.  I have no plans make use of this code moving forward._
